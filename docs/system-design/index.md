# System Design Documentation

Welcome to the EasyFlags system design documentation. This section provides detailed diagrams and explanations of the architecture, flows, and components of the feature flag service.

## Available Diagrams

- [System Overview](overview.md) - High-level architecture of the entire system
- [Multi-Tenant Architecture](multi-tenant-architecture.md) - How the system supports multiple tenants
- [Feature Flag Evaluation Flow](flag-evaluation-flow.md) - The process of evaluating feature flags
- [Tenant Provisioning and Isolation](tenant-provisioning.md) - How tenants are created and isolated
- [Admin UI Workflow](admin-ui-workflow.md) - User interface states and flows

## Key Architectural Principles

### 1. Multi-Tenant by Design
The entire system is built with multi-tenancy as a core principle, ensuring proper isolation and security between different clients.

### 2. Performance-First Evaluation
Flag evaluation is optimized for high-performance with multi-level caching and efficient algorithms.

### 3. Real-Time Updates
Changes to flag configurations are propagated in real-time to all connected clients via WebSockets.

### 4. Scalable Architecture
The system is designed to scale horizontally to support high-volume flag evaluations across many tenants.

### 5. Developer-Friendly SDKs
Client SDKs prioritize ease of use while maintaining powerful capabilities and performance.
