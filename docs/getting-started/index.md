# Overview

Welcome to easyFlags! This guide will help you get up and running with our high-performance feature flag service.

## What are Feature Flags?

Feature flags (also known as feature toggles or feature switches) are a software development technique that allows you to enable or disable functionality without deploying new code. They decouple feature release from code deployment, giving you greater control over the full lifecycle of features.

## Why easyFlags?

easyFlags is designed for high-performance environments where every millisecond counts:

- **Ultra-fast evaluation**: Sub-10ms response times
- **Highly scalable**: Designed to handle millions of evaluations per second
- **Real-time updates**: Changes propagate instantly via WebSockets
- **Sophisticated targeting**: Target users based on attributes with powerful rules
- **Multi-tenant architecture**: Securely isolate teams and environments

## Integration Steps

Getting started with easyFlags is simple:

1. **Setup an Account**: [Sign up](https://app.easyflags.example.com/signup) for easyFlags
2. **Create a Project**: Set up your first project and environments
3. **Create Feature Flags**: Define your first feature flags
4. **Install the SDK**: Choose from our [client libraries](../sdk/index.md) for various platforms
5. **Implement in Your Code**: Start using feature flags in your application

## Quick Example

Here's how simple it is to use easyFlags with our JavaScript SDK:

```javascript
// Install the SDK
// npm install @easyflags/sdk-js

// Initialize the client
const client = new FeatureFlagClient({
  apiUrl: 'https://api.easyflags.example.com',
  apiKey: 'your-api-key'
});

// Check if a feature is enabled
const isEnabled = await client.getBooleanValue(
  'new-feature',  // Flag key
  false,          // Default value
  {               // User context for targeting
    userId: 'user-123',
    userRole: 'premium'
  }
);

// Use the flag value
if (isEnabled) {
  // Show the new feature
} else {
  // Show the existing experience
}
```
